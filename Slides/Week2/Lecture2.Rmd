## Today's Outline

**Intro to R (Part I)**

- R and RStudio
- Basic syntax
- Assigning objects
- Scalars, vectors, matrices
- Control flow: Loops and conditions


## What is R?

R is an open source programming language with a particular focus on statistical programming

- Originally developed as 'S' by Bell Labs in 1993


## R in comparison

## R interface (console-only)

- Command line, unlike SPSS/Stata
- An interpreted programming language
- Purist’s interface: Text-editor & copy paste


## R with RStudio

RStudio is an Integrated Developer Environment (IDE) and serves as: 

- Code editor

    + Code highlighting/completion, indentation, …
    + Feed code from editor to R-console
    
- Project manager
- Workspace viewer
- Data browser
- Enhanced output viewer
- Help browser


## Using RStudio

**RStudio windows at startup**

- Source editor
- Console
- Workspace
- Multi-purpose-panel

**Projects**

- A working directory for each project
- Code: .r files
- Dataset/Workspace: .Rdata files


## Using RStudio (II)	

**Basic Workflow**

- Edit in code editor (.r-file)
- Paste to console
- Save Workspace/Datasets (.Rdata-file)
- Save code routinely (no auto-save!)

**Shortcuts**

- Run code from editor: Select line and ctrl+Enter
- Switch between source and console: ctrl+1, ctrl+2
- Clear console: ctrl+L
- 'Arrow up' gives you the last line of code in the console
- Press Alt+Shift+K to see all keyboard shortcuts


## Fundamentals of the R language

- Use # to comment code (will not be run)
- Case-sensitivity: ```data``` vs ```Data```
- Assigning objects: <- and =

```{r, echo = T}
# Assign the number 5 to an object called number
number <- 5
number
```

```{r, echo = T}
# Assign the character string Hello World
string <- "Hello World"
string
```    

## Functions

Functions perform operations on the input given and end in ()

```{r, echo = T}
# e.g. find the class of number
class(number)
```


## Operations on scalars

You can use R as a calculator:
```{r, echo = T, eval=F}
2 + 3
2 - 3
2 * 3
2 / 3
```

Functions on scalars: 
```{r, echo = T}
a <- 5
factorial(a)
```

## Special values in R

- `NA`: not available, missing
- `NULL`: does not exist, is undefined
- `TRUE`, `T`: logical true
- `FALSE`, `F`: logical false


## Finding special values

| Function  | Meaning              |
| --------- | -------------------- |
| `is.na`   | Is the value `NA`    |
| `is.null` | Is the value `NULL`  |
| `isTRUE`  | Is the value `TRUE`  |
| `!isTRUE` | Is the value `FALSE` |


```{r, echo = T}
absent <- NA
is.na(absent)
```


## Operations

| Operator | Meaning                  |
| -------- | ------------------------ |
| `<`      | less than                |
| `>`      | greater than             |
| `==`     | equal to                 |
| `<=`     | less than or equal to    |
| `>=`     | greater than or equal to |
| `!=`     | not equal to             |
| `a | b`  | a or b                   |
| `a & b`  | a and b                  |


## Naming objects

- Object names cannot have spaces

    + Use `CamelCase`, `name_underscore`, or `name.period`

- Avoid creating an object with the same name as a function 
(e.g. `c` and `t`) or special value (`NA`, `NULL`, `TRUE`, `FALSE`).

- Use descriptive object names

- Each object name must be unique in an environment.

    + Assigning something to an object name that is already in use will overwrite the object's previous contents.
    
    
## R is object-oriented

Objects are R's nouns and include (not exhaustive):

- character strings
- numbers
- vectors of numbers or character strings
- matrices
- data frames
- lists


## Vectors

A vector is a container of objects put together in an order.
```{r, echo = T}
# Define a vector
a <- c(1,4,5)
b <- c(3,6,7)
```

```{r, echo = T}
# Join multiple vectors
ab <- c(a,b)
```

```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
# Find vector length (number of its elements)
length(a)
```

```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
# Reference vector components
ab[4] # Index one element in vector
ab[4:6] # Index several elements in a vector
ab[ab==6] # Index with condition
```


## Operations on vectors

| Operation     | Meaning                  |
| --------      | ------------------------ |
| `sort(x)`     | sort a vector            |
| `sum(x)`      | sum of vector elements   |
| `mean(x)`     | arithmetic mean          |
| `median(x)`   | median value             |
| `var(x)`      | variance                 |
| `sd(x)`       | standard deviation       |
| `factorial(x)`| factorial of a number    |


## Task 1

Calculate the mean of the vector 1,99,3,4,5,6,8. What‘s the mean if you out the 'outlier'?


## Task 1 (solution)

Calculate the mean of the vector 1,99,3,4,5,6,8. What‘s the mean if you out the 'outlier'?

```{r, echo = T}
# Defining vector using sequence between 3 and 6
a <- c(1,99,3:6,8) 
mean(a)

# Calculate the mean of a but exclude the highest number
mean(a[a!=max(a)])
```


## Matrices

A Matrix is a square 2 dimensional container, i.e. vectors combined by row or column

- Must specify number or rows and columns `matrix(x,nrow,ncol,byrow)`

    + x: vector of length nrow*ncol
    + nrow: number of rows
    + ncol: number of columns
    + byrow: TRUE or FALSE, specifies direction of input


## Task 2

Assign a 6 x 10 matrix with 1,2,3,…,60 as the data.


## Task 2 (solution)

Assign a 6 x 10 matrix with 1,2,3,…,60 as the data.

```{r, echo = T}
m <- matrix(1:60, nrow=6, ncol=10)
m
```


## Referencing matrices

- Like vectors, you can reference matrices by elements

    + `a[i,j]` refers to the ith row, jth column element of object `a`

- Can also reference rows/columns, these are vectors

    + `a[i,]` is ith row, `a[,j]` is jth column


## Task 3

Extract the 9th column of the matrix from the previous problem. How can you find the 4th element in the 9th column?
    
    
## Task 3 (solution)

Extract the 9th column of the matrix from the previous problem. How can you find the 4th element in the 9th column?

```{r, echo = T}
m[,9]
m[4,9]
m[,9][4]
```


## For() loops

For() loops are used to loop around a vector/matrix to do something.
```{r, echo = T}
m <- matrix(1:5, nrow=1, ncol=5)
m
for (j in 1:3){
     m[,j]=0
}
m
```


## For() loops (II)

You can also 'nest' a `for()` loop in another `for()` loop
```{r, echo = T}
m <- matrix(1:15, nrow=3, ncol=5)
for (i in 1:2){
  for (j in 1:4){
    m[i,j]=0
  }
}
m
```


## Task 4

Create a matrix with `matrix(1:20,nrow=4,ncol=5)` and another with `matrix(NA,nrow=4,ncol=5)`. Adapt the second to the first matrix using `for()`

- hint: define a 'counter‘ variable that increments by 1 each time you move to the next cell


## Task 4 (solution)

Create a matrix with `matrix(1:20,nrow=4,ncol=5)` and another with `matrix(NA,nrow=4,ncol=5)`. Adapt the second to the first matrix using `for()`


```{r, echo = T}
counter=1
m1 <- matrix(1:20,nrow=4,ncol=5)
m2 <- matrix(NA,nrow=4,ncol=5)
for (j in 1:5){
  for (i in 1:4){
    m2[i,j]=counter
    counter=counter+1
  }
}
```

## Task 4 (alternative solution)

Create a matrix with `matrix(1:20,nrow=4,ncol=5)` and another with `matrix(NA,nrow=4,ncol=5)`. Adapt the second to the first matrix using `for()`


```{r, echo = T}
m1 <- matrix(1:20,nrow=4,ncol=5)
m2 <- matrix(NA,nrow=4,ncol=5)
for (j in 1:5){
  for (i in 1:4){
    m2[i,j]=m1[i,j]
  }
}
```


## If() statements 

If() statements are used to make conditions on executing some code. If condition is true, action is done. 
```{r, echo = T}
a <- 3
b <- 4
number <- 0
if(a<b){
  number=number+1
}
number
```

Tests for conditions: `==; >; <; >=; <=; !=`

## Task 6

Create the two objects `a <- sample(c(4,0),20,replace=TRUE)` and 
`m <- matrix(a,nrow=4,ncol=5)`. Now recode all the 4s into 1s using if() and for() statements.


## Task 6 (solution)

Create the objects `a <- sample(c(4,0),20,replace=TRUE)` and 
`b <- matrix(a,nrow=4,ncol=5)`. Now recode all the 4s into 1s in `b` using if() and for() statements.

```{r, echo = T}
a <- sample(c(4,0),20,replace=TRUE)
b <- matrix(a,nrow=4,ncol=5)

for (j in 1:5){
  for (i in 1:4){
    if (b[i,j]==4){
      b[i,j]=1       
    }
  }
}
```
