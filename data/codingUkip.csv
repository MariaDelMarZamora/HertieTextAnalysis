Timestamp,Email Address,If only all politicians could believe in Britain as UKIP does.,"If only they could share our positive vision of Britain as a proud, independent sovereign nation,","a country respected on the world stage,","a major player in global trade,",with influence and authority when it comes to tackling the pressing international issues of the day.,This manifesto is our blueprint for a Britain released from the shackles of the interfering EU.,This makes it markedly different to those of the other main parties.,"While we see a free, prosperous, healthy, international future for Britain, their cowardice binds our country to a failing super-state that tells us what to do and does not listen to what we want.","Our manifesto also throws down the gauntlet to those who have ridiculed us, jeered at us and lied about our voters, our people and our policies.",It tells the truth about what UKIP stands for.,It takes care of Britain's finances too.,"Taxpayers could get so much better value for their money if we left the EU,","made reasonable cuts to the foreign aid budget,","replaced the unfair Barnett formula,","scrapped HS2,","ended ""health tourism""",and cut the cost of government.,These are our plans and they give us a budget to invest in Britain the other parties can only dream of.,"Without adding a penny to our burgeoning national debt, without cutting vital services and without raising taxes, we can, over the course of the next parliament:",Invest an extra £12 billion into the NHS;,put £5.2 billion more into social care;,build a dedicated military hospital,and abolish hospital parking charges,End income tax on the minimum wage;,cut income taxes for middle earners;,scrap inheritance tax;,"abolish the ""bedroom tax""",and increase the transferable personal tax allowance for married couples and civil partners,"Fund 6,000 additional posts spread between the police service, the prison service and the Border Agency.",Cut business rates for small businesses,Waive tuition fees for students taking a degree in science; technology; engineering; maths or medicine,Increase defence spending to 2 per cent of GDP to honour our NATO obligations,Invest £1.5 billion into mental health and dementia services,Pay carers an extra £572 a year,Build 500 affordable rent homes every year,and eight halfway house hostels for homeless veterans,"Remove stamp duty on the first £250,000 for new homes built on brownfield sites.",Our fiscal plans identifying how we will fund these policies have been rigorously and independently assessed by the Centre for Economic and Business Research (Cebr).,"The Cebr has been extremely diligent and has challenged us frequently, so voters can be assured our manifesto commitments are sound and affordable.","Ours is an amazing country, but it could be better still.",As Mark Reckless said when he joined UKIP last year: we are more than just a star on someone else's flag.,Our approach to the economy revolves around restoring incentives for workers by cutting taxes,"and ending the current ""open door"" arrangement for European labour that has driven down wages in recent years.","By the end of the next parliament, UKIP will: Raise the personal allowance to at least £13,000 so people can earn enough money to cover their basic living costs before the state starts to take income tax out of their pay packets.",This will take those on minimum wage out of tax altogether,Abolish inheritance tax.,Assets bought out of taxed income should not be taxed again when their owners die.,"We will strike out the hated ""death tax"".","It hits the middle classes hardest, those who have worked to provide for their dependents, because the wealthiest almost always manage to avoid paying it","Raise the threshold for paying 40 per cent income tax to £55,000","and introduce a new intermediate tax rate of 30 per cent on incomes ranging between £43,500 and £55,000.",A tax originally designed for high earners should not be levied on middle-income earners such as school teachers and senior nurses,"Increase the transferable tax allowance for married couples and civil partners to £1,500.","The longer term aspiration of a UKIP government will be to create an income tax structure of a basic rate of 20 per cent, an intermediate rate of 30 per cent, and a top rate of 40 per cent, meaning income taxes will be flatter and lower.",Bringing down taxes on working people at the bottom and in the middle ranges of the income scale is our priority.,"In the longer term, we will aim to restore the personal allowance to those earning over £100,000 and make 40 per cent the top rate of tax for all, as it used to be.","Outside the EU, we will have control over VAT.","Significantly, we will be able to deal with distortion imposed by EU legislation and zero-rate certain goods and services that have previously had VAT charged on them.","This means we can - and will - remove VAT completely from repairs to listed buildings and sanitary products, for example.",It is grossly unfair that a few multi-national corporations have been able to access all the benefits of our thriving British consumer market without making a proper contribution to the costs of British society.,The public has every right to be angry about this.,"By restoring British tax sovereignty, which we lost when we signed up to the EU,",we will end the practice of businesses paying tax in whichever EU or associated country they choose.,Our membership of the EU enables companies to avoid paying some UK taxes with impunity and we will close this loophole.,We will also set up a Treasury Commission to monitor the effectiveness of the new Diverted Profits Tax and bring in any further measures necessary to prevent large multinational corporations using aggressive tax avoidance schemes.,Years of mismanagement by Labour and Conservative governments have left our public finances in a mess.,"The public sector deficit in 2014/15 is expected to be around £90 billion and our national debt close to £1.5 trillion, £500 billion more than it was when David Cameron took over in 2010.",This is a terrible legacy to leave our children and grandchildren.,"Interest payments on our national debt alone cost £46 billion every year: more than £700 for every man, woman and child in the country.",It is more than we are spending on defence.,"The Chancellor has failed to stick to his 2010 promise to wipe out the deficit by the end of the current parliament, despite damaging cuts to public services.","In the March 2015 Budget, a new deficit reduction schedule was unveiled, envisaging the elimination of the deficit by the third year of the next parliament, with a surplus being recorded after that.","While this current Treasury plan is a reasonable target, there is little public faith it will be achieved, coming as is does in the wake of previous failure.","UKIP MPs in the next parliament will make sure the Treasury sticks to this latest plan, with no backsliding.",We will hold the next Chancellor's feet to the fire when it comes to improving public finances.,"UKIP will make a difference by being a powerful, much-needed voice in favour of sound financial management.",UKIP will finance a fairer tax system and fund our public spending proposals by sharp reductions in spending on specified public sector programmes.,By the end of the next parliament we will: Save £9 billion a year in direct net contributions to the European Union budget by leaving the EU,"Reduce the overseas aid budget from 0.7 per cent to  0.2 per cent of GNI, matching the percentage contribution made by the USA.",This change will be phased in so projects in progress can be completed and contractual obligations met.,Annual savings will increase to £11 billion by 2019/20 and money for bilateral aid projects will not be languishing in EU bank accounts,"Save £4 billion a year in capital expenditure by scrapping the HS2 vanity project, which will benefit the few at the expense of many",Reduce spending by £5.5 billion by replacing the Barnett Formula,We will also immediately restore the mandatory long-form census to ensure that decisions on housing are made using the best and most up-to-date data available.
