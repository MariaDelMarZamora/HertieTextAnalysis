Timestamp,Email Address,A strong economy starts with a strong middle class.,Our plan offers real help to Canada's middle class and all those working hard to join it.,"When our middle class has more money in their pockets to save, invest, and grow the economy, we all benefit.",We will give families more money to help with the high cost of raising their kids.,"We will cancel tax breaks and benefits for the wealthy ""including the Universal Child Care Benefit""",and introduce a new Canada Child Benefit to give Canadian families more money to raise their kids.,"With the Canada Child Benefit, nine out of ten Canadian families will receive more than under Stephen Harper's confusing collection of child benefit programs.","For the typical family of four, that means an additional $2,500 in help, tax-free, every year.","Because the Canada Child Benefit is tax-free and tied to income, it also provides greater support to those who need help the most: single-parent families and low-income families.","Our plan will lift 315,000 Canadian children out of poverty.",Stephen Harper thinks that government should provide child support payments to millionaires.,"We will give middle class Canadians a tax break, by making taxes more fair.",We will end that unfair giveaway.,"When middle class Canadians have more money in their pockets to save, invest, and grow the economy, we all benefit.",We will cut the middle income tax bracket to 20.5 percent from 22 percent â€“ a seven percent reduction.,"Canadians with taxable annual income between $44,700 and $89,401 will see their income tax rate fall.","This tax relief is worth up to $670 per person, per year or $1,340 for a two-income household.","To pay for this tax cut, we will ask the wealthiest one percent of Canadians to give a little more.","We will introduce a new tax bracket of 33 percent for individuals earning more than $200,000 each year.",We will cancel income splitting and other tax breaks and benefits for the wealthy.,Income splitting costs the federal government $2 billion a year but delivers benefits to only a few.,It will not create a single job.,It will not give one young person an opportunity to get ahead.,"Income splitting delivers no benefits to working parents who earn similar salaries, no benefits to single parents, and no benefits to Canadians who do not have kids.","All told, income splitting benefits only about 15 percent of Canadian households.","We will cancel Stephen Harper's tax breaks for the wealthy,",to give Canadian families more money to raise their children.,We will invest to create more jobs and better opportunities for young Canadians.,"After ten years under Stephen Harper, good-quality job opportunities for young Canadians are tougher and tougher to find.","Faced with high unemployment and underemployment, many young people have stopped looking for work altogether.",This is hard for both young people and their families.,"Many parents are seeing their household debt rise and retirement savings dwindle as they struggle to support their grown children, who often return home.",It is time to invest in young Canadians to help them get the work experience they will need to start their careers and contribute fully to our economy.,"We will create 40,000 good youth jobs including 5,000 youth green jobs each year for the next three years, by investing $300 million more in the renewed Youth Employment Strategy.","We will more than double the almost 11,000 Canadians who access Skills Link each year.",This program helps young Canadians including Aboriginal and disabled youth make a more successful transition to the workplace.,"After this initial three-year boost in funding, we will set the renewed Youth Employment Strategy's funding level at $385 million per year a $50 million increase from 2015/16.","We will invest $40 million each year to help employers create more co-op placements for students in science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and business programs.","And to encourage companies to hire young Canadians for permanent positions, we will also offer a 12-month break on Employment Insurance premiums.","We will waive employer premiums for all those between the ages of 18 and 24 who are hired into a permanent position in 2016, 2017, or 2018.","We will also work with provinces, territories, and post-secondary institutions to develop or expand Pre-Apprenticeship Training Programs.",This will provide up to $10 million per year to help young Canadians gain the skills they need to enter high-demand trades.,"We will end the rule that discriminates against new workers and those re-entering the workforce by requiring them to accumulate 910 hours of work to qualify for Employment Insurance benefits, including training support.","We will invest $25 million per year in a restored Youth Service Program, to give young Canadians valuable work and life experience, and provide communities with the help required for much-needed projects.",We will provide Canadians with a more secure retirement.,"After a lifetime of hard work, Canadians have earned a secure and dignified retirement, but too many now wonder when or even if that will happen.",We will help Canadians realize their goal of a secure retirement.,That security starts with a strong and stable pension program.,"We will work with the provinces and territories, workers, employers, and retiree organizations to enhance the Canada Pension Plan.",We will not end pension income splitting for seniors.,"We will also restore the eligibility age for Old Age Security and the Guaranteed Income Supplement to 65, putting an average of $13,000 into the pockets of the lowest income Canadians each year, as they become seniors.",We will help to lift hundreds of thousands of seniors out of poverty by increasing the Guaranteed Income Supplement for single low-income seniors by ten percent.,"This will give one million of our most vulnerable seniors who are often women almost $1,000 more each year.","Because many seniors live on fixed incomes, we will introduce a new Seniors Price Index to make sure that Old Age Security and the Guaranteed Income Supplement benefits keep up with seniors' actual rising costs.","We will also make the Compassionate Care Benefit more flexible and easier to access, so that those who are caring for seriously ill family members not just family members who are at risk of death can access six months of benefits.",We will make it easier for Canadians to find an affordable place to call home.,"Today, one in four Canadian households is paying more than it can afford for housing, and one in eight cannot find affordable housing that is safe, suitable, and well maintained.","When affordable housing is in short supply, Canadians feel less secure and our whole economy suffers.","We will renew federal leadership in housing, starting with a new, ten-year investment in social infrastructure.","We will prioritize investments in affordable housing and seniors' facilities,","build more new housing units,","and refurbish old ones,","give support to municipalities to maintain rent-geared-to-income subsidies in co-ops,",and give communities the money they need for Housing First initiatives that help homeless Canadians find stable housing.,We will encourage the construction of new rental housing by removing all GST on new capital investments in affordable rental housing.,This will provide $125 million per year in tax incentives to grow and renovate the supply of rental housing across Canada.,We will modernize the existing Home Buyers' Plan to allow Canadians impacted by sudden and significant life changes to buy a house without tax penalty.,"This will ease the burden on Canadians facing job relocation, the death of a spouse, marital breakdown, or a decision to accommodate an elderly family member.","We will direct the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation and the new Canada Infrastructure Bank to provide financing to support the construction of new, affordable rental housing for middle- and low-income Canadians.","We will conduct an inventory of all available federal lands and buildings that could be repurposed,",and make some of these lands available at low cost for affordable housing in communities where there is a pressing need.,"We will review escalating home prices in high-priced markets, like Toronto and Vancouver,",and consider all policy tools that could keep home ownership within reach for more Canadians.,We will also immediately restore the mandatory long-form census to ensure that decisions on housing are made using the best and most up-to-date data available.,We will make post-secondary education more affordable.,"For too many Canadians, rising costs have made post-secondary education increasingly out of reach.","It is harder and harder for middle class families to save for their kids' education, while many lower-income families are not able to save at all.","At the same time, the federal government spends billions each year on non-refundable tax credits that offer little direct help for students when they need it.",We will provide direct help to students from low- and middle-income families to help them pay for their education and ensure that debt loads are manageable.,"We will increase the maximum Canada Student Grant for low-income students to $3,000 per year for full-time students,","and to $1,800 per year for part-time students.","In addition, to help more students from middle class families qualify for Canada Student Grants, we will increase the income thresholds for eligibility, giving more Canadian students access to even larger grants.",This investment will be funded by cancelling the poorly targeted education and textbook tax credits.,The tuition tax credit will be maintained.,"This will increase the level of non-repayable grant assistance to students by $750 million per year, rising to $850 million per year by 2019/20.",We will also make our student loan system more flexible.,"We will ensure that no graduate with student loans will be required to make any repayment until they are earning an income of at least $25,000 per year.",This will be done by changing the income thresholds in the Repayment Assistance Plan for recent graduates.,The federal government will continue to pay the interest on student loans until graduates begin to earn sufficient incomes to take over their own payments and repay their own loans.,"We will work with provinces and territories to ensure that they do not assume any additional costs,",and to make sure these investments go directly to students.,Appropriate compensation will be offered to provinces and territories that do not participate in the Canada Student Loan program.,"We will also work collaboratively with provinces and territories,","to improve promotion of RESPs and Canada Learning Bonds,",and to make registration simpler for all families.,"We will invest $50 million in additional annual support to the Post-Secondary Student Support Program, which supports Indigenous students attending post-secondary education,",and will allow the program to grow in line with increasing demand.
